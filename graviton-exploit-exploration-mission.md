# Graviton Exploit Exploration mission

This program provides rewards for the most comprehensive, well-considered and fully described submissions of potential vulnerabilities of Graviton app frontend, backend infrastructure, and smart contracts. 

## Rules

Please have a look at the bullet points below before starting your exploration mission.

* **All bug reports must be submitted to** [**info@graviton.one**](mailto:info@graviton.one)**, preferably with the subject "Graviton Exploit Exploration".**
* Public disclosure of a vulnerability makes it ineligible for a reward.
* Please note that the infrastructure  on Fantom and Ethereum, or Gnosis safe wallet are not part of the Exploit-Explorer Mission \(only Graviton products are subject  to testing\).

## Rewards

Graviton Exploit Exploration Mission considers a number of variables in determining rewards. Determinations of eligibility, quality assessment and all terms related to an award are at the sole discretion of multisig signers.

### Template

Please, submit a vulnerability using to the following template:

_The points_ [_marked with an asterisk_](https://context.reverso.net/%D0%BF%D0%B5%D1%80%D0%B5%D0%B2%D0%BE%D0%B4/%D0%B0%D0%BD%D0%B3%D0%BB%D0%B8%D0%B9%D1%81%D0%BA%D0%B8%D0%B9-%D1%80%D1%83%D1%81%D1%81%D0%BA%D0%B8%D0%B9/marked+with+an+asterisk) _\(\*\)_ [_are obligatory_](https://context.reverso.net/%D0%BF%D0%B5%D1%80%D0%B5%D0%B2%D0%BE%D0%B4/%D0%B0%D0%BD%D0%B3%D0%BB%D0%B8%D0%B9%D1%81%D0%BA%D0%B8%D0%B9-%D1%80%D1%83%D1%81%D1%81%D0%BA%D0%B8%D0%B9/are+obligatory)_._

* Your name \*
* Your Telegram account \*
* Short description  of a vulnerability \* _Example: Remote Denial-of-service using non-validated blocks._
* Attack scenario \* _Example: An attacker can attempt to mine blocks which may require some resource-heavy computation \(up to the maximum gasLimit\) but provide no proof-of-work. If the attacker sends blocks continuously, the victim node may be forced into 100% CPU utilization._
* Components _Example: Go client version v0.6.8_
* Reproduction \* _Example: Send a block to a testnet node which contains many txs but no valid PoW \(or a link to a Github Gist with reproduction details\)._
* Details _Any other details not covered. Can also contain links to GitHub Gists, repos containing code samples, etc._

## Exploration Field

You can find the list of the test smart contracts **on Fantom** to be examined in the table below. Please note that any submissions of the [user application](https://v1.graviton.one/) bugs are also accepted.

Through the Faucet contract, you will be able to receive 100 test tokens per user \(TestGTON and TestLP\) required for testing the PortGTON Ð¸ PortLP contracts.
