Graviton's yield farming system consists of three components: treasury farming that establishes the initial liquidity for GTON, staking of farmed GTONs and the inter-chain DeFi reward.

These three components of the Graviton system, and the parameters thereof, can be configured by community governance.  


## Treasury farming 

This type of farming includes two options: early-backers’ treasury farming and backers’ treasury farming

### Early-birds’ treasury farming

Early-birds’ treasury farming will be available for a limited period after the launch of Graviton. The minimum investment is the equivalent of $1,000 in DAI, USDT, USDC, BUSD, HUSD, TUSD, UST, sUSD, mUSD, USDK, USDP, GUSD or USDN. Users that make investments during this period become early-bird investors and are entitled to a 10% share of the entire farming income in GTON, which remains a fixed percentage after the early-bird period ends and never gets diluted. The 10% share will be divided between all early birds in proportion to their input. The usage of early backers’ Treasury as collateral for GTON initial liquidity is crucial to set Graviton’s tokenomics in motion.

### Backers’ treasury farming

Following the early-backer period, the regular-backer option will become available, with no minimum investment limit. All investments will have to be made in USD-pegged stablecoins, such as DAI, USDT, USDC, BUSD, HUSD, USDT, TUDS, UST, sUSD, mUSD, USDK, USDP, GUSD or USDN. However, unlike the early-bird's fixed share, the share of regular backers will be diluted as their number grows.  


## Staking-based farming

### How does staking work?

GTON can be used in several ways. First, all Graviton farming rewards will be paid in GTON. Second, GTON will be listed on exchanges and used in liquidity pools of various AMMs, which will boost its liquidity. Third, GTON will be used as the Graviton’s governance token.

Let's expand on the last point – the governance functionality.

The Graviton governance system includes various governance roles that correspond to functions or actions taken by Graviton users. See table 1.

| Category | Roles | Share by category |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Backers | backers | 3,00% |
|  | early backers | 10,00% |
| LP | LP-GTON, LP-WT, governance stakers | 33,00% |
| Strategic partners | partners and investors | 20,00% |
| Operations | treasury, oracle, community, influencers | 14,00% |
| Core Contributors | consuls, core development team, multisig | 20,00% |

One role, consuls, adopts increased governance powers and therefore increased responsibility. Consuls can make proposals for protocol enhancement and modify the mechanisms that underpin the project's economics, such as yield farming income distribution, fee charging and accrual, GTON staking models etc. Consuls will also vote on all key decisions regarding Graviton development and will be delegated GTONs to vote on behalf of other users. This option will be added in one of Graviton's subsequent releases. 

Users who have farmed GTON tokens with their treasury investment, will be able to stake their tokens to specific consuls, thereby delegating them their voting power. We refer to this process as "staking-based farming."

Tokens can be sent to staking-based farming automatically, when distributed between the consuls based on the latter's default weights in total governance \(consuls' default weights can also be set by governance\). Alternatively, tokens can be sent to farming manually, with users deciding how many tokens will be sent to which consul. 

### Where are GTON staking rewards coming from?

Graviton can integrate various kinds of inter-chain infrastructure that issues wrapped tokens. For instance, initially all blockchain networks connected to Gravity or Multichain.xyz will be usable as either origin or destination chains for issuing wrapped tokens by locking the origin chain's assets in bridges. 

To do the opposite – unwrap tokens and send them back to the origin chain – a user might have to pay a fee in GTON.

Fees will be accumulated in a separate fund that will be regularly distributed between GTON stakers. This fee model is supposed to incentivize users to make inter-chain transactions and support tokens’ liquidity by making their withdrawal to the origin chain less attractive. Still, this model can be changed by a governance vote.

## LP farming

### Wrapped tokens’ LP farming

This type of yield farming represents the central part of Graviton and reflects its primary goal of incentivizing users to provide liquidity to wrapped tokens.

In the token wrapping process, assets from origin chains locked in bridges are sent to yield farming in various protocols and АММs, such as Curve, SushiSwap, PancakeSwap and others.

Proceeds from this type of yield farming constitute another source of rewards that can be distributed based on a governance vote. For instance, the proceeds could be used to buy back GTON in the market to redistribute among existing GTON holders.

As soon as wrapped tokens have been issued in the destination chain and sent to farming by a user, LP farming becomes available as the system automatically tracks the issued tokens. Liquidity providers will receive LP tokens that will be automatically included in their portfolios and could be sent to Graviton farming. Liquidity providers' income in GTON will depend on the amount of earned LP tokens, as well as the asset, the pool, the exchange and the blockchain in which the exchange operates. The equation for calculating liquidity providers' income based on the above mentioned parameters will be determined by a governance vote and can be corrected under a consul's proposal.

Pools for GTON farming can be of several types: wrapped tokens against volatile assets, wrapped tokens against stablecoins, wrapped tokens issued on Graviton against the same tokens issued in other chains. The last type of pools will facilitate LP token farming without impermanent loss, similar to multichain.xyz.

### GTON LP farming

Users are also encouraged to provide inter-chain liquidity for GTON. GTON can be claimed \(or harvested\) and sent to pools on multiple farms to receive LPGTON. These LP tokens will be automatically included in users’ portfolios on Graviton and can be sent to farming to receive additional income in GTON.
