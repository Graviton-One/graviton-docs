# $RELICT Token

$RELICT is a mintable reward token distributed in the farming and staking mechanics of GTON. The farms used in Candy protocol and GTON Staking are giving rewards in $RELICT token. $RELICT can be swapped via a smart contract to $GTON (in one direction only).&#x20;

The reward mechanics of $RELICT are similar to the mechanics of $SUSHI or $CAKE. These tokens are deployed on multiple chains but their price is not the same: this is a concequence of  changing block times. Initially, there is going to be a sufficient amount of $RELICT minting per block, so that it can be changed 1-for-1 to around 15% of $GTON total supply in a year. $RELICT minting per block is a constant value but its exchange price to $GTON is set by governance and can be modified at any time through voting.&#x20;
